        <p>I am in <strong>grade 10</strong>, I ðŸ’™ coffee. Gaming is my favorite thing
          to do on PC, along side coding websites. My favorite subjects are English,
          Algebra, Physics. I am in a group on whatsapp called palyers, it's dumb,
          but who cares? I enjoy chatting on it with my friends, practically, <em>we're
            all dumb</em> on the group. One last thing, I've been in love with sitting on
          computers since I was a kid, literally.</p>

  <h2>Education life</h2>

  <p>My education life was fluctuating in terms of <em>schools</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Firstly, I went to a school back in the day when I <em>used
        to live in Alexandria</em> called <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://bls.school">Brilliance</a></strong>. It was neat, I stayed there till
      grade 3, then we <em>moved to Cairo</em>, specifically in Rehab city.


    </li>

    <li>After moving to Cairo, I went to <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://manaretheliopolis.com/#">Manaret Heliopolis</a></strong> schools in Nasr
      city, it wasn't far, but it was really a bad school. I didn't like it, but I
      stayed there for a year.</li> <br>


    <li>Then, I went to <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.noorschools.net/Default.aspx">Noor</strong></a> which was a good school, but the last
      year for me in it was pretty garbage. It started getting worse, good teachers
      left and I was in grade 4 at that time, so I had to leave it.

    </li>

    <li>Lastly, I went to <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nozhaschools.com/f_home.asp">Nozha</a></strong> <em>Ismailia rd branch</em>. It was the best
      school I've gotten into. I stayed there from grade 5 till now. Teachers are
      good, kind and educated. Of course, not all of them, but I can say most of
      them are well educated.

    </li>
